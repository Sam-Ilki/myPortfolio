    <div class="parent">
        <p>Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, 
            when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type 
            specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into
            electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. </p>
