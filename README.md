# myPortfolio

Created utilizing mobile first design.
Created with responsive layout for different screen sizes using CSS grid and media queries.
My portfolio is created to showcase my skill to prospective employers by not only creating a responsive webpage from scratch but also in the projects that I complete both from within the thinkful curriculum as well as projects created outside of the curriculum.

To view, user will have to clone this repo onto their local machine or by utilizing available online resources to view a live version of my portfolio.
